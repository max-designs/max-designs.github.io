    <p> The purpose of this project was to research and develop a linear narrative of a typographic process. The goals included implementing an intuitive hierarchy, dynamic use of space, clear information dissemination, and technical proficiency. Overall my final version came about from selecting the general concept from my first sketch, which was one of the two sketches the professor was drawn towards. I think I can say that in terms of hierarchy I was successfully able to create a functioning design that works well in that regard.
