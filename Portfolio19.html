    <p> This project was for a motion graphics class and the task was essentially to create a logo animation. The goal was essentially to create my own sort of logo and find some creative way to animate it and give it movement. I looked at several examples online and wrote down things about them until I later used Adobe After Effects to design and make the animation. It resulted in a rather satisfactory project where I learned more about the software I was using.
