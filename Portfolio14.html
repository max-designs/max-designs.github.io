    <p> The purpose of this project was to create an infographic that utilizes type as a primary visual element and to pick a topic that was either a Creative Resume Snapshot or about The State of Graphic Design (information such as type of salary per experience, etc). My chosen topic was The State of Graphic Design. My basic goal here was to explore how to layout data/information while still putting the typography as the primary visual element. And so I did a few sketches for a design, tried out different font pairings, and eventually also settled on a color palette. So in this project I learned how to better manipulate colors in relation to how they are capable of eliciting emotions and such. So for instance the color yellow brings out rather optimistic and happy feelings and one would naturally want that kind of thing to come from something such as an infographic displaying information about graphic design salaries and benefits.
