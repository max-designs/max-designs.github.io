    <p> The purpose of this project was to use 3D modeling to create a piece of art that somehow incorporates the broad theme of monsters as the subject. And so part of the theme or the goal was to have some sort of concept to go along with in a sense.  So what I did here was I made some sketches, looked at images for inspiration, and then eventually used the software “meshmixer” to do what I set out to do. How it ended up turning out was that I took a bit of inspiration from the artist Sophie Kahn and the sort of incompleteness or hollowish sense found in her work. The monster retains a phone in hand and the way that is part of the overall concept is that essentially we need to be careful when we mindlessly scroll and become so absorbed with our devices that we appear, or are practically dead inside in a sense.
