    <p> This project was centered around watching a movie and 
essentially creating 40 icons that not only represented the movie, but represented the order of how the events of the movie took place. So, from the first icon to the last icon, all of the icons more or less represent in some way the narrative of the movie from beginning to end. For this project, the movie I chose to watch was the movie “Rushmore”, and I created a series of sketches on paper, that was sort of the foundation for what I made on Illustrator, until I eventually made  the final versions at the end. I also created a couple of mockups as well, one of them from a pattern I later made out the icons. As well as a sticker sheet that consists of 10 of my icons. It was fairly simple and easy, but I still liked how it turned out. Overall I think that this project resulted in a neat series of illustrations that represented a chosen film in unique ways.
