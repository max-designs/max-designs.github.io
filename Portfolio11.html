    <p> In this project I was tasked with creating and animating a walk cycle. The intended goals here were basically to draw a character and a background, and to have the character move and walk while at the same time have elements in the background with movement as well. So here I used Adobe Animate to do this and in my animation I have the character, as well as his shadow below him walking on the moon, while the clouds move back and forth and the stars move in such a way that they sort of “twinkle” in the background. I later had to make some necessary revisions and that all resulted in the animation being a little more fluid essentially, and I also put in some background music as well.
