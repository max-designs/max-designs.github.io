    <p> The task of this project was essentially to create a JPL inspired poster on Adobe Illustrator. So for this project I created a few sketches, settled on a design, and then tried out several color variations, and received feedback throughout the process, until I finally ended up with my final revised version. Although I feel like this project was quite challenging at the start, overall in the end I think I can say I was satisfied with how it ended up looking. I like how I modified the rockets at the end and I like the gradients used. I like the layout and overall think I managed to give it this sort of space poster feel to it.
