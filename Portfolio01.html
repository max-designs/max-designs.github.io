    <p> In this project I was tasked with finding a type of problem and designing a solution for it. I decided on designing an app on Adobe XD that would help new UWF students coming from out of town, state, or country, (be it freshman or otherwise) in familiarizing themselves with Pensacola. Where to find places to eat, transportation, things to do on and off campus, as well as places that offer discounts to students, etc. In this project I created sketches to help aid in my ideation phase as well as created a moodboard for inspiration. Also made low-fidelity, and then high-fidelity wireframes for my project. Upon later receiving useful feedback I made some revisions that resulted in a much more clear and concise design overall.
