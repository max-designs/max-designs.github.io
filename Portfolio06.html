    <p> This task was about creating what is known as ‘cut up/cut out” photography. Essentially the goal here was to create a sort of collage photography wherein I would take a few photos and, using photoshop, I would try to creatively mix them together in a way. Of course color correction would be applied here as well and this project also further helped me develop my photoshop skills to a degree.
