    <p> This project here was about redesigning a brochure about parental linkage from the Florida Department of Health. The goal here was to not only redesign it but to also create a mockup in order to give an idea of what it would look like in real life. So I basically made this using Adobe Indesign and did the mockup using photoshop. So all in all this was a very satisfactory project that at the very least certainly gave me more experience using the Adobe tools I used for design.
