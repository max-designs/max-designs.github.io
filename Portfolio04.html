    <p> This project is about displaying information about a
particular typeface while at the same time showing the
typeface in an illustrative way. In other words, it is to show all of the different ways the typeface can be seen or utilized. For instance, a requirement of the project is to show all of the characters one can use with the typeface. As well as explain the history regarding the typeface and that of its creator. All this while having a design that manages to catch the eyeâ€™s attention efficiently and creatively. My work consisted of researching a little bit about the creator of the typeface as well as looking at other works in a similar vein to this project task to aid as inspiration. This certainly helped me develop my illustrator skills at the time, at least from a more conceptual angle so to speak.
