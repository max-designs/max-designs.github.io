    <p> The purpose of this assignment is to use our knowledge of and experience with the laser cutter from the course to create some type of medal, symbol, coin, token, emblem, or the like. Specifically from a technical point of view, the point is to design it all on Adobe Illustrator and then take the vector image and use the laser cutter tool to essentially create it and have something to hold in oneâ€™s hand. Conceptually, it is very broad because the symbol can be almost anything, it can be a superhero/supervillain chest symbol, dome sort of military badge or medal, some sort of special coin or an award as well. For me, what I ended up making leans more towards a sort of superhero symbol in a way. What I did was make some sketches, do some research into these kinds of images, until finally settling on a design and undertaking the process of creating the object itself. Which resulted in a neat little experience where I did something a little different than what I am used to as a designer.
