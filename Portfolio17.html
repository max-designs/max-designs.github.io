    <p> This project was about recreating the Saul Bass’ poster for the film ‘The Man With The Golden Arm’. In this case, the goal was also related to color harmony and symbolism, but more specifically, I was tasked with creating analogous, split complementary, tetradic, and triadic posters. One of each, so four total. A lot of this involved using the pen tool on Illustrator to try and recreate the poster right. Overall this resulted into a neat little project where I learned a bit more about color and its involvement in design.
