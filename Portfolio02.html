    <p> The task for this project was to create a series of advocacy 
posters from a topic of my choosing. In this case I chose to center my posters around the topic of plastic bags. So my goal here with this project was essentially to create posters that visually and effectively communicated the message of the harm that plastic bags can cause to the world and the environment. I also created an infographic that provided a timeline of the history of plastic bags to go along with them as well. And while the infographic was made in illustrator, the posters were all made in photoshop. The end result was a set of overall cohesive infographic and posters that effectively and clearly tell you what they are about and grab the viewerâ€™s attention while doing so.
