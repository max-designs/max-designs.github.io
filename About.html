    <p> My name is Maximiliano Arroyo, I am 22 years old and I am currently studying graphic design at the University of West Florida. As a graphic design student at the University of West Florida set to graduate in the Fall, I have developed a passion for creating visually appealing designs that effectively communicate a message. My experience with graphic design software has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of design principles, including color theory, typography, and layout. Through my coursework, I have also gained a proficiency in various design software and tools that have helped me bring my ideas to life. I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set in the field of graphic design.
