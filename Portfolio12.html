    <p> What I did here was create an animation reel that consisted of several different animations that were made during my 2D animation course. And the goals that I was trying to accomplish with this project was essentially creating an animation from one project to another while maintaining a kind of fluidity or consistency throughout. And so what I did basically was take the different frames of the projects and paste them together  in Adobe Animate and so this resulted in a series of animations with smooth transitions between each other with the walk cycle fading to black at the end.
