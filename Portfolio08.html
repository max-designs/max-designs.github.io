    <p> This particular project is from a course called “Advanced Ideas and Concepts”, and this is called the “voice project”. Although what this is really about is creating a project that speaks about identity on a conceptual level so to speak. So here I drew inspiration from how my life has been in order for me to think of this idea that I tried to visualize. Which is that basically that many people perceive us differently as they see us in different environments and situations. Your mother will certainly see you differently than a friend, a professor, or even of course a stranger you’ve just met. Over time people may come to see more of you but what people end up getting most of the time are shards, fractions, or reflections of you. And so here, essentially, you have this sort of diamond or crystal that has these different parts of you that people may see, like fractions or reflections of you, but that the center is like your “core” or “whole self” in a way. This resulted in a pretty good visual representation of what I was trying to convey where both the instructor and I seemed to be pleased with how simple yet effective it turned out.
